## 💡 Initial Idea

The concept behind Mugen was to create a **right-to-left oriented website** to provide a unique design that reflects the reading direction of manga. The **seinen demographic** was chosen to give the website a "darker" aesthetic. The name **Mugen** (meaning "infinity") was selected because it aligns with the logo's design—featuring a red square in the top-right corner to symbolize an "infinite gate to the manga world."

## 🎨 Project Colors

The aesthetic of Mugen is defined by a minimalist color palette:

- **White**: for clean, readable typography.
- **Black**: for a bold, dark background that highlights content.
- **Red** and **Bordeaux**: accent colors to reflect the mature and intense themes of seinen manga.
